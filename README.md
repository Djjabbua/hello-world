# hello-world
First try to GH!
This is djjabbua, and this is my frist attempt at GitHub usage, or coding. 

If future djjabbua Reads this, I hope that you have already conquered the planet with science, logic and discussion. You are not alone, and you will surround yourself with valuable people. By the time we manage to create our first programme, then we will have succeded in the first step to accomplish this!
